# BLMReclamationBenchmarks

Supplemental files for BLM reclamation benchmarks

This repository contains a shapefile with benchmark values by ecoregion ("BenchmarksSpatial) and a shapefile of well pads found on BLM land in the ecoregions of interest ("BLMwellpads"). There is a csv metadata file ("Metadata") that defines the attributes of BenchmarksSpatial. 

There is also a folder ("Example") that contains code for fuzzy cluster analysis of an example ecoregion (Ecoregion 24). The formatted monitoring data tables for Ecoregion 24 are included for use in the fuzzy cluster analysis example.
